										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Situation:</strong> When Group CJ was called upon by the Lexington Convention and Visitors Bureau to create Lexington’s first ever restaurant week and dining guide, we spotted a unique opportunity to not only engage our locals but expose visitors to an exploding local cuisine scene. The problem was, the last thing restauranters want to do is add yet another project to their already busy plates.</p>
<p><strong>Hot Idea:</strong> A little communication savvy to tame our local culinary rock star owners and chefs, and we now have a hip dining guide, dubbed Beyond Grits, and have wrapped up Lexington’s inaugural Restaurant Week in July.  Wherein visitors and locals alike were encouraged to venture out and discover new favorites among our happening cuisine scene.  Our accompanying website features extensive listings, category maps, feature owner/chef profiles and helps dining go-ers find the newest hot spots in town.</p>
<p><strong>Cool Results:</strong> Lexington’s Restaurant Week was a smashing success, and dining guides are flying - and we just keep having to print more. And oh how the tables have turned. Owners are trying to track us down to be featured, assist and get involved in any way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><!-- <strong>Situation:</strong> The Mall at Lexington Green has a thoughtful mix of specialty shops and popular retail stores. Whether you are shopping for travel, pleasure, health, or wishing to dine, you'll find it all at The Mall at Lexington Green. This makes for a very unique challenge: how do you market some many different entities as one cohesive brand?

<strong>Hot Idea:</strong> Rather than emphasize one store over another and rotate through different stores each month, Group CJ took a very different approach. We united all of the stores under a very progressive, clean, and female focused campaign. A campaign that wasn't afraid to let its chic flag fly. The majority of the stores at Lexington Green are very female focused, such as anthropologie, Chicos, francesca's, and evereve. With so many female clothing stores, it made sense to focus on the female consumer.

&nbsp;

<strong>Cool Results:</strong> We believe our clean, sleek, chic, and progressive Lexington Green ads speak for themselves. This is one campaign we are particularly proud of. --></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This group is comprised of several hot shot local restaurants - Drake's, Malone's, Sal's, Harry's and Aqua Sushi (Regatta and the Boathouse before closing them last year). Our work with this fun bunch of restaurateurs started off with a bang! Group CJ was pulled in just a few short weeks to rebrand and launch the new Drake's in Lansdowne. From picking the beers to decor to menus and ads, we were behind the scenes every step of the way. We continued to refresh the other brands - giving Sal's a fresh new sophisticated look, helping Harry's push their happy hour crowd and assisting with internal communications, employee training and a new comprehensive workhorse website, bluegrasshospitalygroup.com.</p>
